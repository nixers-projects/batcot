Brought to you by dami-ooooh <dami0@iotek.org> & deadcat <dcat@iotek.org>

Copyright 2013-2014 also by those above mentioned cool cats.

Commands:
---------
```
        .seen - displays time since users last message
        .set  - sets the desired option to a value
        .np   - last played/currently playing track
        .tz   - displays the time in the current timezone
        .list - lists descriptions available through .<word>
        .ping - pong
        .yrmt - be right back
```


Usage:
------
```
        .seen  - takes argument of a username
        .set   - takes argument of [tz/np] followed by timezone [GMT/EST] or
                 last.fm username, NB: Caps in tz setting. Also available are
                 best/worst, in the form of .set best/worst <message>
        .np/tz - takes argument of timezone or user, if .set has been used,
                 passing no argument will use the stored value. If passing an
                 argument and .set has been used, the argument will override.
```

Complaints:
-----------
```
        It's best to use the IRC channel rather than my iotek mail since I
        haven't used in quite a while. If I'm unresponsive, send me a memo.
        If you have no idea what that means; "/msg memoserv help" for more
        information, on the IRC server of course.
